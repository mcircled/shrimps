So before you start programming, you should understand and make sense of the word. My point is that you have to understand what programming is, and also the difference between coding, programming, and development.

To clear up this misconception, you can look it up in any dictionary or just look it up on Google, but as a software developer, I'll describe it in terms of software development. So, let's get started.

## Coding

As a software developer, coding for me means writing computer instructions into a file. To code, you must understand a programming language and its key/core elements. For example, coding is to print a variable to the standard output, receive data from the input stream, create a function that adds two numbers and so on. Here, the coding lines are neither managed nor organized. 

Instructions are obtained from your teacher or client and converted/translated into computer code using a programming language.

## Programming

When it comes to programming, it is not only lines of code, it is the arrangement, segmentation, and modelling of an actual object as code. You should have in-depth knowledge of object-oriented concepts, i.e.  From inheritance to encapsulation, from abstraction to generics, from generics to composition. 

Understanding data structures and algorithms are by far the most important aspect of being a programmer; D&A is the foundation, and every programmer must have a deep understanding of the data structures, and algorithms.

## Development

Development is more than simply programming; it encompasses the entire process from conception to implementation. It includes putting your idea on paper, designing a prototype, and developing an MVP, as well as ensuring cross-platform/OS compatibility (e.g., by using docker), and understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the chosen stack, database, and architecture.
