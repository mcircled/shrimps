So, while you are reading this, you are either having your meal, breakfast or browsing the web to help you manage your time/day. Probably, you are trying and tried lots of techniques, suggestions and methods to do so, but you failed all the time, right!

Why you have failed, to manage your time, your day, or to put it more simply, why you are not doing what you do efficiently and on time? There might be reasons, right, no there are reasons, and you don't know how to push back these hurdles and make yourself prominent and mindful.

In this piece of writing, I will try to help you to get some fuel, and also some extra guidance to help you drive your bicycle on a better road, and productivity.

So let's start.

## Productivity is not what you think of it

Your productivity is not what you think, most people think of it as getting work done in time or before time, but it's more or less than that, for me productivity is to do what I am doing without wasting time. If I am writing, I will try to give time, and start writing unless I gain some guidance and outcome of my piece of writing and become happy with it, like doing it right now, writing this article.

## Don't Plan

I haven't chosen to do it in the morning, evening or night, I have time, utilize it to the most important work you have, and the most important work is to stay you, be yourself no more, no less.

In simple words, do what you are doing, the focus should be totally on it, doesn't matter the value, you gain from it. By doing so you are preparing your system 1 (unconscious mind) to not resist other things. Your brain will get trained to stop only once you have achieved productive satisfaction, not hormonal satisfaction.

## Time doesn't matter

Time does not matter here, what matters is obedience, consistency and motivation. Consistency with the time, obedience to the rules, and motivation to calm for the results.

``Be mindful, do what you are doing.``
