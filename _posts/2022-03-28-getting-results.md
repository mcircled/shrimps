In the [previous article](/a-1-better-day "previous article"), I was writing an article about getting a 1% better day and spending the time which it needs to get complete and get productive, but there is still one missing thing that can bring the real productivity out of the time and effort you spent.

and the missing thing is getting results.

## Getting results

The missing thing as I mentioned is getting results, so what kind of results for someone it can be subscriptions, likes, money and acknowledgement, and for some other person it can be an improvement in analytical thinking, knowledge and mental growth, so it differs from person x to person y.

## Outcome is not result

The last article's outcome was to guide someone to really understand what actual time management is and understanding the actual time management, but no result. Let me explain it by an example e.g a product developed by a company is not the result that the company wants, the result is the profit or loss earned by the company by selling the product.

## Keep result's in mind

If you are doing something keep in mind the results you want. The results that can make you more consistent, more obedient and more motivated, and +1% every day.

``Be conscious, do what you are doing.``
