In the [previous article][#prev_article], I was writing an article about get a 1% better day and spent the time which it needs to get complete and get productive, but there is still one missing thing which can bring the real productivity out of the time and effort you spent.

and the missing thing is getting results.

## Getting results

The one missing thing as I mentioned is getting results, so what kind of results for someone it can be subscriptions, likes, money and acknoledement, and for some other person it can be improvement in analytical thinking, knowledge and mental growth, so it differs from person x to person y.

## Outcome is not result

The last article's outcome was to guide someone to really understand what actual time management is and understanding the actual time management, but no result. Let me explain it by an example e.g a product developed by a company is not the result which the company wants, the result is the profit or loss earned by the company by selling the product.

## Keep result's in mind

If you are doin some thing keep in mind the results you want. The results that can make you more consitent, more obedient and more motivative, and +1% every day.

``Be concious, do what you are doing.``
